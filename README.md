# 🛡️ Real-Time MLOps Fraud Detection System

This project is a real-time, end-to-end MLOps platform for detecting fraudulent transactions. It integrates model training, experiment tracking, API deployment, and dashboarding in a modular and reproducible way.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Real-time fraud prediction via FastAPI
- Interactive dashboard using Streamlit
- Automated training with hyperparameter tuning (Hyperopt)
- Experiment tracking with MLflow
- Modular pipeline (data → train → deploy → monitor)
- Designed for local (Docker) and cloud (EC2) deployment

## 📦 Tech Stack

**MLOps:** MLflow, DVC, Airflow  
**Serving:** FastAPI  
**UI:** Streamlit  
**Modeling:** scikit-learn, XGBoost, Hyperopt  
**Infra:** Docker, AWS EC2

## 📂 Dataset

### Source: Synthetic Financial Datasets for Fraud Detection

This dataset is a synthetic representation of mobile money transactions, generated using the **PaySim** simulator based on real transaction data from a financial service provider in an African country.

- 📦 **File**: `data/raw/paysim.csv`
- 📈 **Rows**: ~6 million (1 month of transactions, 744 steps = 744 hours)
- 💳 **Transaction Types**: PAYMENT, TRANSFER, DEBIT, CASH_IN, CASH_OUT
- ⚠️ **Fraud Indicator**: `isFraud` (target), `isFlaggedFraud` (flagged high-risk ops)
- 🧾 **Note**: Balances (`oldbalanceOrig`, etc.) should not be used for fraud detection — they are post-processed to reflect canceled fraud transactions.
